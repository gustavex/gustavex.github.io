I'm **Gustavo Vasquez**, an engineer based in New York. <br />
My current interests include *(but are not limited)* to **Computer Science** and **Machine Learning**. <br />
The idea behind this blog is to *(somehow)* give some order and structure to my *(rather vague)* ideas and plans. <br />
I'm fluent in **Spanish**, **English** and **Japanese**.
